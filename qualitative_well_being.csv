They roll over from high school, and think it's the same thing. Schedules vary, time is pregnant in between classes, responsibilities are DIFFERENT. More than EVER, students need an introduction to take FALL QUARTER on ""what is college?"" I can see topics such as:
1. How is college different than high school? 
2. Managing time. Three courses with varied schedules are different than six courses in a row. 
3. Choosing courses. EXPLAIN why they take general education. Explain what they are!
4. UNDERSTAND YOUR STUDY HABITS. Are you a morning person? Do you need a detailed calendar? How to choose a major - show all the majors! What are some of the majors? What majors are similar to my interests? 
5. How to manage assignments. Responsiblities of communicating with professors.
6. How to write an email!
7. How to behave in large lectures, show up or use online. The basics of moving from PANDEMIC education to LIVE education. 


I have had two kids go through the UW and teach one of (and sometimes THE) largest lecture class at the UW. We have discussed this at length. I have also noticed that there is absolutely no introduction to how to choose a major, how to research, or student responsibilities for class conduct and communication, or just the basic idea that college is not like high school. It's a difficult challenge to go from all day in a classroom with professors who constantly are looking over your back (I am married to a high school teacher, we discuss this often) to being completely in control of your own schedule, which is now only three classes with lots of free time in between.

When the UW wants to show ""they care"" they create a new office, highly paid, which orders faculty around and wastes their time making them do busy work to justify their existence. One office requests that faculty and staff be punished administratively for not complying with their demands. There should be a limit on how much ""extracurricular"" work the faculty have to do. It's become so that we have to do our teaching and research in our free time, after dealing with the other UW priorities.

In many discussions I've heard, senior faculty discuss compression as a symbol of status and worth. For newer and younger faculty, the issue is typically expressed as something much more material: the ability to live, work, and raise a family in one of the most expensive cities in the country.

Period. From my perspective, and those of many faculty and staff I speak with in CAS, the top priority is paying us more so we can afford to live and work in this city. While I understand this is among the most difficult problems to solve, for many of us, it is, essentially, the only problem that needs to be solved. Every other issue is downstream of increasing salaries, funding, revenue, and good fiscal management.

My student evaluations are SIGNIFICANTLY lower here than they have been at other institutions. I have a lot of compassion for students and have always worked with each student to help support them the best I can, and that is something that countless students have mentioned in their student evaluations at previous institutions. However, I have had many students complain openly (and often rudely) about basic things like having exams be in-person (even if they are open note), or having to attend class to complete a few in-class activities in a discussion type course (when I let them drop several activities from their final grade across the quarter so they don't have to stress out about missing a couple of classes). 

I know my students would learn more from me if I was not concerned with student evaluations. I would be a much more effective teacher if I could focus on designing courses and activities that are in line with the significant professional demands they will face in the field when they graduate in a few short months. Additionally, we know from many studies that student evaluations are biased against women and people of color. I do not believe student evaluations should be a part of the tenure process and it is imperative that they be replaced by peer evaluations or other metrics. I have had this discussion with many faculty at UW, and at other universities. I believe our student's future patients will suffer because faculty are forced to make courses less and less rigorous so we can get promotions and tenure.

There are no significant incentives to try harder. It is getting very hard to continue working on these salaries with a family and children to support.

And read this below...

I am a teaching professor that teachers over 1200 students every year in the math department.  I have been doing this for 20 years.  I have won the distinguished teaching award, the honors excellence in teaching award, the Panhellenic teacher of the year award among other things.  I am quite popular with students and I love to teach. But this year I am teaching 1400+ students so my workload has dramatically increased.  At the same time in the last 10 years, the number of students with accommodations have dramatically increased (10 years ago 0.5% of my students had DRS accommodations, now it is 4.5%... 10 years ago I had 5 students claim sickness and miss an exam, this year I have had 80 students do this.. 10 years ago I have no students claim religious accommodations, this year I have had 8).  So in addition to my class sizes increasing, my workload per students has also dramatically increased.

While at the same time, I continue to be one of lower paid faculty members in my department (my pay is well below that of ALL the tenured-track faculty in my department including new hires).  

Add to this, I have the highest teaching evaluations in my department (and some the highest on campus) and I have taught more students at UW than any other person in the last 20 years!  But I am told by my chair that the University does not provide a way to reward me financially or with teaching release for my intense load or great evaluations or popularity in classes. He says the university does not consider number of students or teaching quality in distributing money to departments in any way. They also tell me they don't do retention raises for teaching faculty.  So basically, I am told it doesn't matter how many students I teach or how good a job I do.   While at the same time my tenured colleagues teach much smaller classes, many fewer classes, didn't win teaching awards, and get paid almost double what I make (and several of them have very poor teaching evaluations).  

Some of my teaching colleagues have been in my department for 20 years and NEVER been promoted which is truly awful. We are told that the path to full teaching promotion is too unclear to try.  While at the same time tenured faculty in our department get promoted every three years on average.  I was lucky to get promoted, but it is truly awful that my colleagues haven't been.

Ten years ago, tenured faculty in our department made 60% more than teaching faculty.  Now they make about 100% more than teaching faculty.  This is also awful.  

Teaching faculty in our department now to all the course coordination and chair most the committees (so our teaching load, service load has gone dramatically up, but our pay hasn't changed).  Tenured faculty now are chair almost no committees, so service has passed to teaching faculty mostly.

I have all this data and can quantify my complains.  We just met with our chair as a group, and he was also appalled and plans to try to work with us.  But he is constrained by university rules... so we need support from the university administration, please, please help us!

The current situation seems inconsistent with a university saying they value teaching.  I personally have given up on this for myself and just focus on serving my students which is what I love to do.  But I do want to fight for my colleagues to at least get promoted, they are incredible, please help us.",Pay,Realistic faculty workloads,Realistic faculty workloads,Realistic faculty workloads,,,4,3,1 - Highest,1 - Highest,1 - Highest,1 - Highest,1 - Highest,3,5 - Lowest,,,Decrease pay gap,Salary structure,Salary structure,,,3,5 - Lowest,4,5 - Lowest,5 - Lowest,5 - Lowest,1 - Highest,4,,,Family tuition rates,Family tuition rates,Family tuition rates,,,5 - Lowest,5 - Lowest,5 - Lowest,5 - Lowest,5 - Lowest,5 - Lowest,5 - Lowest,,,,,,"
